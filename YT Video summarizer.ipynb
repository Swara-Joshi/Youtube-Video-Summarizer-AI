didn't say I didn't do it I said I didn't have time because I was so busy saving your ass I'm sorry I doubted you I'm sorry I snapped to [Music] you anyone else ever loses faith in me doesn't [Music] matter with you it's different [Music] there she [Music] go why you know [Music] why you know I love you Donna [Music] okay let's go no no no no it's not right it's not right I drank three Gatorades on the way here I'm going to pee orange it's right no what if we're going to do something it needs to be original Orange you know what I know what we're going to do I'm going to get the can opener are you serious right now you're not messing with me you're finally going to tell me what you do with that can opener do I look serious you look stoned I am but I never joke about the can opener come on let's go let's go come on all right what we do is okay if you were a narcissist with great hair what would your password be Harvey Spectre no it's just way too easy one of his favorite basketball players Shaquil oh Bryant I still don't understand the thumb tack thing it's surprising isn't it yeah hey say what you will about this floor pretty sure the cubicles are bigger hey what's going on how you guys doing I was just uh helping box a little bit cuz uh Donna was feeling a little blue about moving what the hell are you doing Harvey Harvey you looking for another way to make my life miserable Harve hary no come on you hit him they [Music] win should have let me hit him uh I don't know about that but maybe we shouldn't have let him leave why maybe he wasn't snooping maybe he was I don't know I'm trying to plaint something like like drugs in my record collection what better place to stash the weed than with the Bob Marley man L doesn't even know where to buy drugs let alone plant them I know where to buy drugs congratulations no I'm serious what if instead of peeing we planted something in hardman's office genius it's a crime maybe but he wouldn't hesitate for one second to do the same thing to get rid of you what he wouldn't hesitate to plant somebody to get rid of me what louw no Hardman I just said that no what if Hardman planted the CM memo in the first place well Donna never saw the memo Donna never makes mistakes what if she never saw it 4 years ago because it wasn't there and then it was you really think he had the balls to walk into that file room open a box and plan a document no security cameras and no locks in the doors fine but how did he get the do in the first place Harman brought Coastal Motors into the firm yeah but he wasn't here when the case went to trial no not the trial the defect what's the date Sarah Leon left CM here Harman was still here makes sense Sarah leaden confronts Kemp he panics who's the first person he calls his lawyer Harbin tells him to bury it that's a crime you said yourself he wouldn't hesitate to commit a crime he knew the cars were bad from the beginning what when Hardman came back the first thing he did was asked Lewis for a report on every case at the firm yeah he was looking for weaknesses he knew the CM win was based on a lie made it look like it was my lie which brings us to Tanner Hardman couldn't bring the suit himself he needed an executioner and he picked Tanner so when I suspected something was fishy I'd focus on Tanner not him Esther what are you doing here I'm actually going out to dinner with ls and Donna well thanks for the invitation but that's the last thing in the world I want to do right now no that's not why I'm here I was thinking about what you said about why I called you first and then about how you handled it and I thought maybe you might want to take me out this weekend Esther what do you think's going on between us I don't know I just you don't know well I'll tell you we had a moment it was nice but I'm not interested in sneaking around who said anything about sneaking around I did and you just got divorced and you're a mother of two and I'm not going to be the reason that that what that nothing why don't you just go out to your dinner Harvey tell me what's going on what's going on is you asked me out and I said no so please just leave me alone Harvey I said leave me alone [Music] did you make the reservation at sths for the seventh time yes and why was it so important that it' be there anyway because their muff are 10 times better than SS and I just wanted her to know it thought you two made progress she's still my sister I can't let her think that she's the best at something okay hey what's wrong you look upset nothing's wrong I'm just not feeling very well it looks like tonight's not a good night after all no no no no you're upset it's not that Louis I just don't feel well please let's just reschedule I'm going to just call the restaurant and wait a second wait a second wait a second she came all the way down here just to cancel I don't know Louis I mean maybe she was already on her way over here and did she just come from Harvey's office because that's the direction she came from not the elevators I don't know Louis what do you want me to say I don't know is exactly what you said when I asked you if you thought there was anything going on between Harvey and Esther and now you're saying it again but you're Donna and you know everything I'm sorry Louis I do know what are you going to do none your business stay out of it you've done [Music] enough you and I are going to have a talk right now okay whatever it is it can wait I need to tell you something does it have something to do with why my sister just left here too upset to go out to dinner you piece of sh I knew it what'd you do to her now I didn't do anything to her Louis and when I say now I mean as opposed to before when you slept with her that's right Donna the one you tried to steal from me at dinner the other night told you calm down I didn't try to steal any you made a promise to me and even after I told you about when Esther and I were kids and the boys used me to get to her you still went ahead and betrayed me Louis it had already happened and I was just now about to tell you [\\xa0__\\xa0] you were never going to tell me you going to keep it to yourself till the day you die Louis you have to believe me I swear I was just about to tell you what you're about to do is get your ass kicked all right watch yourself don't threaten something you can't handle you don't think I can handle you you also thought I was too stupid to find out but I did find out I found out that you're nothing but a lying cheating I didn't cheat with Esther it was two grown people making a goddamn decision for themselves well that decision ended with her walking out of here near tears because she didn't have all the facts like the fact that you're a Serial womanizer who can't stand what anyone else has shut the hell up so he takes whatever woman's inight he's so messed up from whenever godamn thing happened to him in his pathetic childhood shut the hell up he can't hary get away from me you get the hell out of here my woodall's taken care of and so is everything else not everything Jessica Harvey I've already made up my mind you weren't there he helped get us out of this after he put us goddamn in it and I put us in it just as much the day I hired Mike Ross are you looking to save Lewis or to get yourself fired too I'm saying he did some bad [\\xa0__\\xa0] but so have I and so have you you and and I don't mess [\\xa0__\\xa0] up we fix it which is what he did today you want to talk about what he did I told him not to confess and he went straight down to the SEC and he sang like a canary after he did the same thing with Jeff Malone that doesn't doesn't what that's just a tip of the iceberg let's talk about his Greatest Hits last year he blew up our merger negotiations because of a cat this year he led Mike Ross straight to Charles Forceman he unwinded found the Wexler shares after I specifically told him not to and to top it all off he took a million doll payout to commit tax fraud that could have landed you 10 years in jail and he didn't tell us about that until it was too late and he only did that because he had to I'm still not telling that I tell him to do something and he never godamn does it now I told myself I'm going to do something and I'm going to goddamn do it let me do it why you and not me because you want to deliver the message his services are no longer needed and I want to tell him goodbye you're really going to do this [Music] [Music] Harvey this place is all he has I [Music] know I'm coming with you dear Harvey and Jessica there comes a time when a man must look at himself in the mirror to judge himself instead of waiting to be judged by others and for me that time is now you both know I came to pierce inspector right out of law school but what you may not know is this is the only place I've ever worked it's the only place I've ever wanted to work it is my life it is my home and the people that work here are my family you're like my parents and the partners they're like my brothers and the associates under my care are like my children and I'm ashamed to admit it but I put all of you in Jeopardy for my own personal game I told myself it was for the greater good but the truth is I I just wanted to feel on the same level as both of you I I can deny that no longer I can excuse my actions no longer although we've had our differences over the years there are no two people I respect more your names are on the wall for a reason and mine is not for a reason and I refuse to put either one of you through the pain of having to fire me so effective immediately I leis lit am resigning from Pearson Spector please take care of my home let me get this straight you two were in a heated conversation when we picked you up and that had nothing to do with this it had everything to do with it I mean you were trying to cover Your Tracks no we were having a heated conversation about what [\\xa0__\\xa0] charges these are okay I'm done playing your games he was your only friend of that firm you got fired you got him another job and that's why you went to him to set this whole thing up you've got your information wrong he wasn't my friend I had the chance to save his job but instead he threw me under the bus that is why I instituted this lawsuit so you can take your [\\xa0__\\xa0] allegations somewhere else because I am not going to roll on Harvey I'm not rolling on Mike and Harold he's not going to roll on me you guys are well rehearsed so I'll ask you again is that what you were doing on the street today Jesus Christ you know you drive like myana he drives like my nana and she's 102 relax Louis Ray on it nobody's getting us there faster I mean I can't believe this whole thing's been going on I've been completely out of the loop LS I don't want to rehash it right now Mike's in custody we need to get him out yeah and you need to tell me what the hell happened [Music] are you asking if we broke the law when we made that settlement with Herold that's exactly what I'm asking we have [Music] exposure well then you better hope that Ray drives a little goddamn faster because you and I both know what's going on in there let me tell you what we're dealing with here conspiring to bribe Witnesses seven years you filed a sworn declaration in support of your suit that's perjury another two years and it to it all off the money was transferred overseas which would be well you're a lawyer fill in the blank wire fraud Bingo big winner and your prize is 20 more years and here's the thing I am going to make sure that it's not a cushy white color prison this is just ridiculous Harold isn't broken by now I'll my pants Harold's broken then when we get there Mike's going to be on his way to prison someone needs to get in there and hold his hand not someone you are you serious I'm the last person in the world that Harold Gunderson wants to see right now leis when we were Associates who did you fear most that's easy my mother I meant in the firm Daniel Harman so who would you most want to come in and take on Eric Woodall if you were in that room Daniel Harman exactly look Harold may not like you but he respects you and he's all alone now when we get there I need you to channel your inner Hardman get him to trust you and then shut him the hell up l what are you doing here I'm waiting for Harvey Harvey's not here then you'll have to do look leis I know you've been through a lot but Harvey's going to I don't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] what Harvey's going to do okay you're scaring me you know what an Oscar looks like what Academy Award bald guy I me of course we all know what it looks like but especially you you're an actress it's the highest honor in your field I mean of course you don't need to be told what it is what are you talking about see the highest academic honor in Harvard Law is the order of the qua you don't get a trophy you get three things get a parchment to hang on your wall metal to wear at graduation this now this key doesn't say order of the qua doesn't say anything it's just a symbol what does that have to do with Harvey doesn't has to do with Mike you know what Louis it's been a long day it's about to get [Music] longer see Mike asked me about this and I thought he was I thought he was trying to get my mind off of my problems but then he did it again and it got me to thinking Mike graduated Magna loudy he's in order of the qua but he didn't recognize this so he forgot a stupid key M Ross doesn't forget anything see the reason he didn't recognize this was because he never got one because he didn't go to Harvard leis we've been down this road before Mike is in the Harvard database but he's not in the yearbook and according to his credit report is addressed during his law school years was in New York he even paid rent the first of the month in person well I'm sure there's an sit down last year you told me not to tell shill about Mike's file you acted like you cared about me you didn't give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] about me you cared about you and Harvey and mich and Jessica Lis that's not true well let's call Sheila right now I know all of the numbers by heart I mean she may not be interested in me anymore but she will definitely be interested in a fraud claiming that he went to [Music] Harvard I'm sorry [Music] you're sorry you've been lying to me since the day Mike Ross arrived I knew Harvey and Jessica never really accepted me but I thought you were different I thought you were my friend I am your friend Louis no you're not and don't you ever say that to me again where where are you going to see your friend [Music] Jessica leis knows leis I know you're a stickler for the rules so I figured I'd just come by to return my ID you want an explanation I want to see you per walk the bullpen with your pretty little jacket draped over your handcuffs but until then you I'll take an explanation when I found out the truth about Mike Ross it had already been done by Harvey right after he made Senior partner over me that's when he hired the fraud that's the correct timeline right yes so instead of turning him in you cover it up leis and the one time that I do something you don't cover it up at all you throw me to the Wolves I saved you from the Wolves I ask you for the smallest gesture just to allow my career to continue with dignity and you couldn't muster the tiniest shred of [Music] compassion what do you want me to say I want you to tell me you're a liar and a hypocrite [Music] I want you to say you're [Music] sorry I am a [Music] liar and I am a hypocrite but I will not say I'm sorry because I did what I did to protect this firm well it looks like the Captain's about to go down with their ship [\\xa0__\\xa0] you want something oh I told you I want to see you in in handcuffs if that were true the police would be here instead of you no you wanted to see me squirm before asking me for what you really [Music] want I'm not going to give you the satisfaction so you might as well spit it out you asked me what I wanted once before and I told you and then you told me that I couldn't have [Music] it but now I can Pearson [Music] Spectre L Mr Ross we are prepared to hear your final statement before we do I have one last question Mr Ross you say you're a changed man and you care about the truth but I want to know if you're capable of telling the truth so I'm going to ask you a question and I suggest that you consider your answer very carefully because as far as I'm concerned your answer will determine whether or not you become a lawyer during your time at Pearson Spectre lit did anyone there have knowledge of the fact that you were a fraud [Music] Mr Ross did anyone else know I knew and if you're looking for a scalp you can have mine but I was under the impression that this hearing was not about my old firm but whether or not Mr Ross should be a lawyer I say he should it doesn't matter what you say he's already had someone testify for him I'm not here to talk about him I'm here to talk about someone else someone else has nothing to do with I'd like to hear this 15 years ago a young woman was arrested for illegally obtaining prescription drugs turns out she had chronic pain and didn't want to drop out of med school possibly never to return so she stole a couple of prescription pads from the hospital where she was interning a crime with a mandatory sentence of 7 years but instead of throwing the book at her the prosecuting attorney showed Mercy had the charges knocked down to a misdemeanor recommended probation and sealed the records that's a touching story but I don't see what a random attorney has to do with these proceedings she's not talking about a random attorney she's talking about me just because I showed compassion once doesn't mean he deserves it now maybe he doesn't but that young woman is now an ER doctor she saves lives and the world's a better place because you saved hers thank you Miss Pearson Mr Ross I don't think I can add anything to that I've made my case I leave the choice to you then this hearing has concluded we will deliberate and let you know our decision by Day end thank you [Music] so what do we do now they said they would let us know by the end of the day so we'd wait well it is the end of the day which means doesn't mean anything Louis whatever's going on in there sidel's going to fight like hell it's not going to make a difference she's never going to change your mind I think she will what do you mean I mean that story wasn't any old story and that woman wasn't really a woman it was a man named Joseph O'Neal and it was Walter Samson's godson so she did call in a favor yeah she did then we need to get her kicked off that board no Harvey we don't because I didn't fly all the way down here to Strongarm that woman and I know the story of the wind and the Sun what the hell are you talking about she's talking about eso's Fable which basically says that if you want a man to take off his coat you don't blow it off you make him feel warm and he'll take it off on his own that's not a strategy it's a prayer Louis I already admitted that I knew about Mike and I reminded her of her own compassion that's the best we're going to do you know they could despire you for that in New York they might in Chicago nobody's going to Care thank you Jessica don't thank me thank Harvey he's the one that called me Sido hello I'll tell thanks for [Music] calling you're in oh my God it happened I'm going to go get us some champagne thank you so much thank you flying in I would have missed this for the [Music] world Mr Ross I'd like to make your client an offer we're listening we don't want you Mr Diaz you said you were just driving the truck and I believe you and we already have the two gentlemen who committed the actual felony so all you have to do is testify against them and you walk what [\\xa0__\\xa0] no jail time no jail time okay that's enough I need a moment with my client I don't need a moment I'll take it Mr Diaz listen to me testifying against your friends may not seem like a big deal right now but it's something you are going to have to live with for the rest of your life I don't owe them anything and if I can get myself out that's what I'm going to do he's only offering you this because he doesn't have a case against you he's a two-time loser I'll make a case against him Mr Diaz give me the pen you are making a huge mistake yeah well I don't think so and if you were in my shoes You' do the exact same thing I would never send my friends to prison yeah well they find me guilty they're going to send my friends to prison anyways I feel the floor shaking and the glass begin to break the air is Getting Thinner with every breath that I take they come before the storm you could hear the drop of a pin never been claustrophobic but now the walls are closing in so strike me down take me away to do it's time to pay face what I deserve Here Comes J day I would rather gu is mine till I'm it all my crimes face

why I hired you and I told you it was because life is like this and I like this Harvey please you can't convince me let me finish it was like this not because of the risk we're taking because of who you are so you're not disappointed kidding me to that speech if you hadn't done this I'd be kicking you and for the record you're not the only one who got more family out of this steal [Music] [Music]

of my letter of resignation if this is about the thing with Claire or the fight that I got into with my Mom this is about us starting our life right with a clean slate you don't have to do this for me I'm not I'm doing it for us cuz as long as you're with me I'm with you then let me go say goodbye to my office let's go home you walked out before we got a chance to celebrate sorry it's just been a long day Harvey how exactly did you get that termination letter from Forceman let's talk about it in the morning Harvey I agreed to step down absolutely not you are not going to step down it's done nothing's done Jessica please you've given up everything for this firm it's time someone give up something for you what if I don't want you to be the one to do that then forgive me because I am good news is Mike Ross is leaving I never thought I'd say this but at this moment that doesn't feel like good [Music] news Michael James Ross yes you're under arrest for conspiracy to commit fraud and when

            "Hello everyone! I'm Santi and I'm currently working as an Ml engineer, so I'll be discussing the derivation and math behind classification which is another top Ml algorithm. I Have covered log likelihood before in this video and I would say it's kind of a prerequisite for this video. If you already know about that, then without any further. Ado Let's start. So the first thing that comes is what is the problem that we are trying to tackle here? So basically we have. So basically the first question always is what the data set. What does the data set look like? So it looks something like this. As I said, we'll start with the simplest form first. So X1, X2 and Y So Y is basically uh, either zero or one. We'll be tackling binary classification first. So why is either zero or one? Let's say looks something like this and X1 could be 1, 2, 3, 4 maybe and X2 could be anything. Um., 5.9 1.0 1.1 anything. So these X1 X2 are the two features and Y is our Target variable which is either zero or one and we want to predict Y given X1 and X2. So now comes the graph. Exactly what are we trying to find here? So we'll try to plot X1 X2 here, X1 and X2 and then we'll try to get the Uh points here. So let's just say these These are the four points that we have. So now what we're trying to find is this line. Because this line would be distinguishing these points. Suppose this point has Y equal to Um one and this point has Y equal 1. This point has Y equal 0. This point has Y equal 0. So this is the line that we're trying to find that uh differentiates the one yal 1 from yal 0 because suppose now we have any kind of Point. Suppose X1 is here something and we have given X1 and X2 and we find it here and we know that this point lies on this side of the line so Y will be one. It's as simple as that. I Hope you get this. So basically X1 and X2 given X1 and X2 what is our Y that is our Target to find. Given X1 and X2 we want to find Y. Fun Fact: Um, so logistic degression is also called classification. Do you know why? Um, drop your thoughts in the comments. Okay, coming back to this one. So this line in Um classification is called decision bound which is very important. Remember this term. So what is the definition of this line? This line is the maximum distance from all of the points. So what do I mean by that? So here actually we are tracking the distance between the points. so so these these differences these are. This is the DI for each point X1 I and X2 I. We have this point which is Di and this di we want to maximize because we want the line such that it is it. It differentiates the two Uh, one and zero completely. Okay so what is the exactly the equation that we're trying to solve here. So Y I given X I param. This is the equation that we trying to find. Why are we trying to find that? Because if you remember correctly, this is log of this Um summation I = 1 to m M being the total number of data points, M being the total number of data points. So this equation is the log likelihood. So this is is very important. So that is why we trying to find this and we trying to Define this term. So this is actually Y I given XI parameterized by Theta This is actually the Bol distribution because either the probability we are trying to kind of find the probability of it being one or zero and B means only two values. We can predict one or zero. So that is why this is like similar to the Bol distribution. Now that we have got this out of the way, we know what we're trying to find. So now comes the DI. Let's focus on Di. Let's get an equation for finding out Di and formalizing that so if you remember I Just now said, these are all Di. So this line. This side is a positive side of the line and this side is the negative side of the line. So we can either decide um, so we can either decide, we can decide the direction. So let's just say this side of the line is positive and this side of the line is negative. And then this Di. Let's say let's denote Z as Di. So now this is very important to understand so listen carefully. So this Di it can range from positive Infinity to minus infinity. So we trying to find the function so can range from positive Infinity to negative Infinity. Okay so now if Di is zero, let's say for a point, the point is lying on the line so we don't know whether it's positive or negative, whether it's whether it's one or zero. Let's just say positive one gets classified as one. Negative is classified as zero. So if the point is on the line, we don't know whether it's positive or negative. We don't know whether it's one or zero. So the probability is half so Di equal 0 should have the probability as half. We are now trying to find the constraints for for finding the function that will fit Di perfectly. so Di0 P is equal to half. What? If Di is positive Infinity which means that probability will be one and then Di Suppose it's negative Infinity then probability will be zero of getting classified as one. We are finding that we are now currently thinking of p as the probability of getting classified as one this one. So if it's on the line then it see and probability is half if it's Infinity. Which means we know for sure that it's one point is one. so p is equal to 1. and if it's negative Infinity we know for sure that the point can never be one. So it's B is zero. So now what function fits all these conditions? Yes, so that is the Sigmoid function. Write this down. This is the Sigmoid function. So what does this look like? So now we going to see how the Sigmo function looks like. We denote It generally as G as a function of Z. It would be 1 upon 1 + E^ minus Z. This is a Sigmoid function, so let's put in the values and see if it satisfies it or not that we just now saw. So if Z equals Z then what is Gz, It is half perfect. If Z is infinity, what is Gz, Gz is one perfect. Because because 1 by 1 + E^ minus infinity, this would tend to zero. So we have 1. and if Z is minus infinity, then G Z is equal to Z. Why? Because 1 by 1 + E power Infinity This is this tends to Infinity so 1 by Infinity is zero. So now we have a function which satisfies all these points. So now we have our idle function. So Sigmar function is what we are going to use here before. I Delete this. Let's see the curve of the Sigmoid function. so this is one. This is Zer This is half. So at half we have Um, At half, we at zero Z equal to Z. So this is Z This is Gz. So when Z equal to Z then we have half. When Z equal to Infinity, we have one. and when Z equal to minus infinity, we have zero. So somewhat like this is the Sigmoid curve. Remember, this is very important. Comes in interviews, comes in, placements, wherever jobs, internships. This is extremely important. College exams, gate exams, whatever. So this is very important. Um, so now we have the Sigmoid function out of our way. Great one down. So now we'll find out the log likelihood. So probability of Yi = to 1 given X I parameter Iz by Theta probability of Y equal 1 given X I parameterized by Theta Earli it was probability of Yi given XI parameterized by Theta Because Yi was continuous in distinct case, it's a little bit different. So we'll take Yal Yal 1 and we'll take Y equal 0 and we'll get the formula for these two. Then we'll see what to do, how to combine them together. That's very interesting as well. We'll come to that. So this is the Yal 1 given XI parameterized by Theta. So we know we just now found this: 1 + e ^ So now what is this term? What is this term? So basically, if you remember when I was talking about the decision boundary in binary classification is going to be a straight line. Obviously because we trying to divide these points, this distance we trying to maximize this distance we're trying to maximize from all the points. So this is a straight line. So now we know for a function which is the equation of a straight line is Y equal to Mx + C But this is only when uh, it's A. It has only one feature which is X. So we have here two features. So then what what are we going to do? So this is going to be Y = to Theta 1 X1 + Theta 2 X2 + Theta 0 So we have X1 and X2 as I showed earlier in our data set and so we we will use this equation. So basically what does this equation mean and how can we write this equation? So I'll just play a short video here where I've talked about how we can um, get this equation and write it in the form of Yal Theta transpose X So here it starts. it's just a few seconds video. So yeah, so you'll understand why we are writing Y equal Theta transpose X from this equation. Now there's a interesting way to write this. So we want to write it in the form of a vector so that we have um, simple equations to solve instead of this complicated equation with all the variables. So now okay so now Theta how do we represent Theta So Theta would be n + one right. Total number of Thetas will be n+ 1 because Theta 0 to Theta n for each of the X1 to xn feature. So Theta Matrix would be Theta 0 Theta 1 till Theta n 1 Uh n + 1 CR 1 This is our Theta Matrix and our X Matrix looks like this: I already said M cross n right M being the number of data points and N being the number of features. So now our Y would be M. So now if you can see carefully. so um so Theta 0 has one, This is very important. Try to understand this. This is the trick that you will use in most of the algorithms when you're trying to find the Uh any and solve using the vector formula. So this is the one that we have. So let's say if we had X Z, it would have been one. So what we'll do is We'll add a column here of ones So then we'll we'll make this. Let's make this so this would be these are the Nend features we have. Now we'll have another column of Wes so this becomes + one. So this becomes n plus one. So now you can see this is M cross1 This is M CR n + 1 n+ 1 CR 1. So we have a matrix multiplication here. so if we have Theta transpose, what would Theta transpose be like 1 cross n + 1 and then we'll have X So we can write X in the form of like n+ one cross M as well. So that just depends on how you express X. Let's do that. Suppose we want to write X in the form of um n + 1 cross l n + 1 cross M So this is our final X Uh coordinates so this would be n + 1 cross M Now we have 1 cross M which is our Y so we can say Y transpose or we can represent it in the same way as X. So in that case Y would be 1 cross n so it doesn't really matter when you're trying to solve. This is just the way we choose to express this formula and we choose to relate Uh, Y and X and Theta so this would be 1 cross M. So now you have this 1 cross M So you have this equation which which is like very common Y equal theeta transpose X So now that we know this, we know that here we are going to have since this is the probability Yi given XI parameterized by Theta. So this is going to be Theta transpose XI because Yi is one that we focusing right Now that is why this is the positive distance. Yeah so this is the positive distance that we are using Y 1 + E^ minus Theta transpose XI Why are we doing that? So basically what we have done means if you remember Di, we have written that as Theta transpose x I We don't want to get in this perpendicular thing so we are just going to take theeta transpose XI and then which is kind of like removing all the constants Yi so Y equal 1. given XI parameterized by Theta is 1 by 1 E^ minus Theta transpose XI which is our distance positive distance great. Now the next thing is you can already guess what this is going to look like. 1 by one 1 + E the power minus of minus Theta transpose X Basically this is G of minus Theta transpose XI And this is this was G of theta transpose x Side Remember G which is the sigmoid function minus So this is going to be 1 by 1 + e to^ Theta transpose X Great! So now we have this out of the way. It's very important to get the intuition for this because once you understand this U 90% of the problem is done. So yeah, so we are 90% done. So now comes the gradient descent Uh function and how we are going to use this log likelihood function that we just now found out. Um, in order to find out the parameters that is Theta 1 and Theta 2 that is Theta Basically how we are going to use that so we'll be using radiant descent. Obviously, that is the only way here. So now we need to formalize that. So um, basically maximizing log likelihood is Sim is same as minimizing the loss function. So I Hope you've seen the video where I've explained why this is the case and I'll reiterate it. If you do not know this, then it's important to know this before you proceed. Okay, so I I'm going to assume that you know this. So basically maximizing the log likelihood is the same as minimizing the loss function. So now we are going to write a function for the log likelihood. So what we had earlier was likelihood and of two distinct cases. Now we want to combine them together. So this combination, trying to understand this is very very very important. important. I Cannot stress it enough. Okay, so I'm going to use the formula directly. Here is not much. The previous Uh page where I was discussing it was the likelihood function. and now this is the log likelihood just using a log. This the function summation I = 1 to M log of probability of Y I given X I parameterized by Theta Great! So now we are going to break this down such that we can accommod two cases. Listen very carefully. so this is the first one. So when Y = to 1, we want to take the case when Y equal to 1 here. So basically our data set is divided into points such that Y equal 1 and some have Y equal 0. with some some points X1 and X2. So we want to find out those points which have yal 1 and take them here in the first part of the function. So how are we going to indicate that we are going to use? We are going to use something called an indicator variable. So I is basically So let me just go into this a little um in detail. So basically what is an indicator variable? So suppose you have a list of functions. Suppose you have Y here so 1 1, 1, 0, 0. Let's say this is our Y data set and we're using the indicator variable. So if we do here, one of Y I equal 1. This means that um, this means that whether Y is equal to 1 or not. So this is true. So this will take the value one here. Also, it will take the value one here. Also, it will take the value of one. Now here is y1 Y I equal to one? No. So this will take the value zero and this will take the value zero. So do it with me. So if Y I = to 1, I equal 1. 2. There are five points point. So then the answer would be what? 1 + 1 + 1+ 0 + 0 Which is going to be three. So this is the this is the basic Funda of Um indicator variable. So now that we know indicator variable. so now that we know indicator variable we can move on to the next part of this function. So what is going to look like Now you can guess it I think you can guess it Yi equal to0 given X I parameterized by Theta this would be indicator variable of Yi equal to Z Great. So whenever Yi is one, we are going to use this because probability of Yi being one parameterized by Theta given X I and whenever Yi is zero, we're going to use this. So now this log likelihood can be expressed like this very easily. Now the work is almost done. I can say it's 95% done. So now what we want to do is just put in this value. We know this value. so let me just um, let me just clean this up. Okay so now what we going to do is do the substitution and then differentiate that and equate it to zero right? How we know this one probability of Y I = 1 a given x I parameterized by Theta 1 by 1 + e^ minus Theta transpose X I Just nowar wrote it and the other one is probability of Y I = 0 Given X I parameterized by Theta is 1 by 1 + E^ theeta transal x side Okay so now what we going to do is substitute. So this this function would look something like this. this would be Yi by Yi itself because you saw that when I was showing that graph. So if Yi is one then this will be one right. and if it Y is zero, this will be zero. So we can just take Yi and then put in the function here 1 by 1 and for this one we know what is going to be. You can guess it 1 minus Yi. So if Y is 1, this will be zero which is what we want. If Y is zero, this would be one which is exactly what we want. Perfect! So now we have 1 - Yi log of 1 by 1 + E^ th transpose x I Now we have this Great! So now as soon as we have this, our work is done. So it's now 100% done. So we just need to differentiate this and equate it to zero. And then we'll have an equation for our Thetas and we can just use that. Um, we can use it like in gradient descent as you know. So I I'll just come to that. So first let's simplify this before we differentiate. This minus is because I'm putting it here and this would be um, this would have a minus already so we can just y I- 1. Cool. Um yeah. So now let's remember this for fora now that we have this formula, then let's differentiate that Del L equal to Z I'm using Delta again because um we have multiple Dimensions. Um Okay so now we'll differentiate this one and equate it to zero. So let's differentiate. We have this equation. This is basically our LL Theta and this moment and we now want to differentiate this so let's do that. So summation I = 1 to M - Y I we differentiating with respect to Theta so this would be this would get differentiated So as we know, differentiation of log X differentiation. What is differentiation of log X It's one one upon X right? So DDX of log X is 1x X So that is what we trying to use here. and if and one more thing we're trying to use is DDX of so f of X then it is going to be DF DX upon X. This is going to go down and then this will be DF upon DX. So let's use that. So we put this down and now we're going to differentiate this with respect to Um with respect to Theta. Yeah, so with respect to Theta what would that look like this would be zero and this would be E^ minus Theta transpose x I and this would be- XI Correct Yeah, got it. So this one this one done, now the next one next one. So what would this look like Let's see so Yus one would be in that way. Keep that. Oh the same thing. So the below it will go E to the Theta transpose XI and here it will be Theta transpose XI multipli with X I So this is the way it goes and then we're differentiating this one. So E to the^ X differentiation is E to the^ X X. If you know DDX of E^ X is E to^ X that we're trying to use here. So E to the^ X differentiation would be this and then differentiating this with respect to Theta would be XI great. So we now I've got both of these out of the way. This would get plus because of two minuses now. Um yeah. so now if you want see So this term and this term is similar so we're going to glove them together. Now we are going to use a trick. Listen very carefully. Otherwise you'll miss it. Listen very carefully. I'm going to use a very simple trick. very old trick in the dictionary, but I'm going to use that. So if you see here, we have what do we have E to the^ minus x 1 plus E to the power - X right? So now if I let's do that. So if I convert this 1 by E to the power X upon 1 + 1 by E to^ X. Now get this up Here we would have 1 by E^ Min - X we're multiplying with E the^ Min - X We are multiplying e the^ X so we would have E to^ X + 1. Correct. These two are same, You agree. So now we are going to use the same thing with Um E^ X So E to^ X we have 1 + E to the^ X. So now we are going to do is 1 by E ^ - X upon 1 by E ^ - X + 1. So now what will this be? Let's multiply E^ Min - X. We would have 1 by 1 + E^ - x. So does this? Does this look familiar? So now if we convert this one like this, we have the same denominator and we can combine these terms. Excellent right? Remember this trick. This will come in handy later as well. Great! So now you just saw what I did. So I'm going to use that I'm going to convert this one into this form. You will soon realize why am doing this one and not the opposite Y I Eus Theta transpose X I 1 + Eus Theta transpose X I mtip with X I and this one I = 1 to M Y I - one Let's do this one. So what is this going to look like? 1 by 1 + E ^ minus Theta transpose X Correct, You got it. This This is extremely a very neat trick that we use and it solves most of the problems as you just saw. So now we have the same denominator. We can combine these two terms. So um yeah, so let's do that. So let's simplify. So what do we have here? Let's see, we have 1 by 1 + E^ th transpose XI And here we have Yi XI from here E^ minus Theta transpose X I We have plus Y I x I from here and we have minus XI So as you can see here, if you just take Yxi common, we have 1 plus E to the^ minus Theta transpose X I Yes, we are very very close to the formula that we want the simplified form. So let's do that. Y I x I Let's take that common and we have 1 + E^ minus Theta transpose x I upon 1 + E^ minus Theta transpose x I These two get canceled and this is - X I upon 1 + E^ minus Theta transpose x I We are nearing the term that we trying to find, so do not forget this though. it's very important. This derivation is extremely important. Is gold? Pure gold? So great now that we have this so we are trying to find out. Yeah yeah, yeah, we are almost. We are. We like literally at the end. So I'll just take this one out. Put it here. So this is going to be let's take XI out. So we are going to have Y I - 1 by 1 + E^ minus Theta transpose X I multip with X I Does this look same? Does this look familiar? This is what this is. The Sigma function. Correct. So let's put that in here: Y I minus G of Theta transpose X I multiplied X I summ I = 1 to n Perfect. This is the formula that we are that we were looking for. Now that we have this, we know what Delta Theta LL Theta looks like and we will just now, Um, use our gradient dist formula. So remember this formula. We have spent a lot of time and a lot of effort and hard work to get here. So this is very very very important. And if you've got this, then you practically understood classification. You have got it. Yeah, Perfect. now. Uh, now let's let's do that. So now we are going to do the Radiant Desent. So if you know what is gradient descent. So basically gradient descent means uh, I'll just repeat it like in short I have told about it I've spoken about it in my earlier videos but I'll just tell about it. In short: So this is where we are starting. So this is our loss or our L log likelihood that we are starting. Okay, so if we not talking about log likelihood then this would not be the curve in that case because in log likelihood we're trying to maximize it in loss function. We're trying to minimize it so the curve would look something like this. So here we are. Currently this is our log likelihood and we're trying to reach this point which is our top Target which is our maximum log likelihood function. So if you have this, so this is the Target that we're trying to achieve. So what are we going to do? Simple. So we are going to use our gradient descent formula Theta T + 1. So we'll initialize Theta with some random values or zero and then we'll follow this curve. Yeah, so we are going to follow this curve. So Theta T + 1 is going to be Theta T minusa Delta Theta LL Theta Um, sorry minus of this. So practically it's plus. Why is this not said. We are going not in the direction of the slope we going. Um, we are going to maximize the likelihood. That is why we need to move in this direction. which is very important. So now this is our gradient descent formula. So I'll just write it out again. if this is not very cleara what you just need to do is just place the function that we just now derived in here and you have it and you can follow it for as many as you want until you get convergence. This is the learning rate and learning rate determines the rate of convergence and we have Theta at the end of this perfect. We've literally come this far. Then you deserve a methal. You are a genius. You've understood everything and you can tackle any problem of classification. Now, between in interview, in placement, in job in Gate exam in college exam anything great. Great, Amazing! So now just a simple thing. So basically now that we have Theta we know that the equation of the line is going to be Theta transpose X if you remember that I was using earlier. Theta transpose X Correct! So now it's very important to find out. So now we want to find out the equation of the line right. So just remember one thing that we did. so when I was saying that our di is Theta transpose XI right? So and and G of Di or G of C transpose X I would be half if Di is zero. Remember this right? So let's let's get it. Get that from here. So 1 by 1 + E^ minus di is the transpose x I So I'm going to put this in here equal to half. Now solving the equation. what we have it is the transpose E, the^ minus thepose x I 1+ is equal to 2. So this would be 1. So now Theta transpose x I is equal to Z which is exactly the equation of the line that we're looking for and this will be the decision boundary. You remember this one that I was saying earlier. This is the decision boundary The for the equation of this is it transpose x I equal to zero. Perfect! Now we have got everything now. given XI we can easily find out Um, where the line lies and based on the line we have the probability and we know on which side of the line it lies. If it's a positive one, then why equal to one? The classified point is one and if it's on the negative side, it's going to be zero. Great Amazing! Now we are done. Um now you can tackle any problem related to classification. and yeah I hope this answered all your doubts about this topic. Um, and if you have any questions, please drop them in the comments I'll try to answer them. and yeah, please stay tuned for new videos. Thank you.\n"
